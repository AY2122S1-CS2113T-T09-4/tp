## 1. Introduction

Welcome to your all-in-one desktop app for managing modules, tracking your food consumption, time scheduling, journaling, and CAP planning!
We know that you are a CS student here at NUS üë®‚Äçüéì and may prefer typing ‚å® to swiping (Hello Vim! üòâ)
, so we think that our command line interface for cramming & knowledge (Click) is a great fit for you! 

This user guide provides a guide to *traversing* our *array* of features for you to *sort* your life into place.
Every feature of Click is carefully documented, and the syntax requirements are provided for  you to explore.

Jump in to the section [2. Quick Start](#2-quick-start) to get started!

## 2. Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `click.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T09-4/tp/releases/tag/v1.0).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Click.
4. In the home folder for Click, launch the `jar` file using the `java -jar click.jar` command on Command Prompt (for Windows) or Terminal (for Unix-based OS, such as macOS and Linux) to start the app. If the setup is correct, you should see something like this:

```
	__________________________________________________
	 _____ _  _     _
	/  __ \ |(_)   | |
	| /  \/ |_  ___| | __
	| \__/\ | | (__|   <
	\_____/_|_|\___|_|\_\

	Hello! I'm Duke
	What can I do for you?
	__________________________________________________
```

5. Type the valid command into the terminal (or Command Prompt) and press <kbd>return</kbd> (or <kbd>Enter</kbd>) to run the command.

## 3. Features 

**Before you begin, please note the command format:**

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.
  
- The `INDEX` used in various commands must be a number specifying the order of an item in the list of items.
The smallest index would naturally be 1. (1-based)
  
- The `{}` wrapping indicates an optional parameter.

- Parameters cannot be reordered.
  Example: If the command specifies `module add c/MODULE_CODE n/MODULE_NAME`, keying in `module add n/MODULE_NAME c/MODULE_CODE` will result in an invalid command.

## 5. Frequently Asked Questions

We know you are a curious individual, so here
are the answers to some frequently asked questions about Click.

Can I use Click on different operating systems such as Windows and macOS?
>Yes. Click is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux as long as you have Java 11 or above installed in your machine.

What will happen to my data if Click crashes when I'm using my laptop? My battery life is pretty bad.
>Data is saved automatically to `STORAGEFILE` whenever you change your tasks. Therefore, your data will be safely saved even though Click is crashed.

Can I exit Click without using the bye command? I recently learnt shortcuts  such as <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd> and <kbd>Alt-F4</kbd> and would rather
forcefully exit the app.
> Yes, you can. As mentioned above, your data will be saved automatically if a change of the tasks occurs, so you can exit Click worry-free.

This app seems to replicate what I'm currently  doing on paper, such as writing my tasks on a physical calendar,
and recording my calorie count on a journal. I'd like to  know some  benefits of  this over paper.
>  Sure, while we acknowledge your  love of pen and paper we'd like to remind you the scalability of digital apps,
>  preservation of data as well as  the efficiency of the CLI in typing rather than writing.
