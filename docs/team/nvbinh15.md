# Project: Click

## Overview

Click is an all-in-one desktop app for managing modules, tracking your food consumption, time scheduling, journaling, and CAP planning!
We know that you are a Computing student here at NUS 👨‍🎓 and may prefer typing ⌨ to swiping (Hello Vim! 😉)
, so we think that our command line interface for cramming & knowledge (Click) is a great fit for you!
