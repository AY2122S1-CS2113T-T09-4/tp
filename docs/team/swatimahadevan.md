# Project: Click

## Overview

Click is an all-in-one desktop app for managing modules, tracking your food consumption, time scheduling, journaling, and CAP planning!
We know that you are a Computing student here at NUS üë®‚Äçüéì and may prefer typing ‚å® to swiping (Hello Vim! üòâ)
, so we think that our command line interface for cramming & knowledge (Click) is a great fit for you!

## Summary of Contributions

**Major Enhancement**:
1. Calendar display feature - Displays the calendar to the user when the following command is given: `calendar display [MM-YYYY]`. This feature was the most effort-consuming considering that I had to implement a consistent display (explained in the DG Section 4.3.1 under Design Considerations). 
2. Calendar task add feature - Adds a task to the calendar when the following command is given: `calendar todo n/ [TASK_NAME] d/ [DD-MM-YYYY]`. The code for this portion was taken from the ip and tweaked to accept date of the task as well.
3. Calendar lecture add feature - Adds a lecture to the calendar when the following command is given: `calendar lecture m/ [MODULE_CODE] s/ [DD-MM-YYYY(START_DATE)] e/ [DD-MM-YYYY(END_DATE)]`.
4. Calendar task list feature - Lists all tasks when the following command is given: `calendar list task`.
5. Calendar lecture list feature - Lists all lectures when the following command is given: `calendar list lec`.
6. Calendar task edit feature - Edits a task when the following command is given: `calendar edit [TASK_INDEX]`
7. Calendar related storage
